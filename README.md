## Installation


Fork this [remote repository](http://github.com/pk664/shopping-cart) under your own control, then "clone" or download your remote copy onto your local computer.


After cloning the repo, navigate there from the command-line:

```sh
cd shopping-cart
```

Use Anaconda to create and activate a new virtual environment, perhaps called "shopping-env":

```sh
conda create -n shopping-env python=3.8
conda activate shopping-env
```

From inside the virtual environment, install package dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> NOTE: if this command throws an error like "Could not open requirements file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory", make sure you are running it from the repository's root directory, where the requirements.txt file exists (see the initial `cd` step above)
